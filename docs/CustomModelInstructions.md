# Custom Model Training Instructions

Follow these steps to train a custom model using the YOLOv8 algorithm.

## Step 1: Unzip Training Data
1. Navigate to the `\data\TrainingYolo\TrainingDataYolo` directory in your project repository.
2. Locate the zipped folder named 'data'.
3. Unzip the folder to extract the images and labels required for training.

## Step 2: Select YOLOv8 in Streamlit Application
1. Open the Streamlit application.
2. Look for the option to choose the YOLOv8 algorithm.
3. Select YOLOv8 as the chosen algorithm for training.

## Step 3: Choose Offline Data
1. Locate the sidebar in the Streamlit application.
2. Find and select the option for 'Offline Data'.

## Step 4: Start Model Training
1. Click on the 'Train Model' button to initiate the training process.
2. The training process may take a while, depending on your hardware capabilities.
3. Once the training is completed, a new folder named 'runs' should be created.

## Step 5: Select 'Custom' Model
1. Find the 'Select YOLOv8 Model' dropdown menu.
2. Choose the 'Custom' option from the dropdown menu.
   Note: Selecting this option before training your own model will result in an error.

Congratulations! You have successfully trained a custom model using the YOLOv8 algorithm.
